    Ensure that the slider is fully responsive on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices, particularly on Apple mobile devices.
    To ensure high-quality images, please make sure they are in webp format and have a good resolution. Make sure all images are less than 100 kb.
    When scrolling on mobile devices, it is necessary for there to be fade-in and fade-out effects (It is advisable to avoid utilizing jQuery and swiper.js).
    It is important to optimize code and include relevant comments.
    Just a heads up, any task submissions with copied code from the internet won't be accepted.
    The display of both images and text should only be visible on tablet-sized screens.
